## Introduction

Building a blog that's both developer-friendly and performant has always been a challenge. With **Next.js** and **MDX**, we can create a blogging system that allows us to write in Markdown while embedding React components directly in our posts.

In this guide, we'll walk through the complete setup of a modern blog system that includes:

- Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Custom React components
- GitHub Flavored Markdown support
- Static site generation for maximum performance

## Setting Up the Project

First, let's install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
bun add gray-matter reading-time next-mdx-remote rehype-pretty-code shiki remark-gfm
```

### Project Structure

Here's how we'll organize our blog content:

```
content/
  blog/
    my-first-post.mdx
    another-post.mdx
lib/
  blog.ts
  mdx-renderer.tsx
app/
  blogs/
    [slug]/
      page.tsx
```

## Writing MDX Content

MDX lets you use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, and even write them inline. Here's an example:

<Callout type="info" title="Why MDX?">
  MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components,
  making it perfect for technical blog posts that need interactive elements.
</Callout>

### Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are automatically syntax-highlighted using Shiki. Here's an example:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  date: string;
  tags: string[];
}

function getAllPosts(): BlogPost[] {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(BLOG_DIR);
  return files
    .filter((file) => file.endsWith(".mdx"))
    .map((file) => parsePost(file))
    .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime());
}
```

### Tables

Tables are supported through GitHub Flavored Markdown:

| Feature             | Status | Notes                     |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| Syntax Highlighting | Yes    | Powered by Shiki          |
| Copy Button         | Yes    | One-click code copying    |
| Dark/Light Theme    | Yes    | Automatic theme switching |
| Custom Components   | Yes    | MDX component embedding   |

### Task Lists

- [x] Set up Next.js project
- [x] Configure MDX processing
- [x] Add syntax highlighting
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Add search functionality

## Custom Components

<WarningBox title="Important Note">
  Always test your MDX components in both light and dark modes to ensure they
  look great in all themes.
</WarningBox>

### Using Callouts

Callouts help draw attention to important information:

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  You can use the `Callout` component with different types: `info`, `warning`,
  `danger`, `tip`, and `success`.
</Callout>

## Performance Considerations

When building a blog with Next.js, keep these tips in mind:

1. **Use Static Generation** — Blog posts rarely change, so use `generateStaticParams` to build pages at compile time.
2. **Optimize Images** — Use `next/image` for automatic image optimization.
3. **Minimize Client JavaScript** — Keep your MDX components server-rendered when possible.

## Conclusion

With this setup, you have a powerful blogging system that's:

- **Fast** — Statically generated pages
- **Flexible** — Embed any React component
- **Developer-friendly** — Write in Markdown
- **Beautiful** — Syntax highlighting and custom styling

_Happy blogging._
